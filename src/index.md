# Intro

Hi, I am Artem, a UI developer interested in design systems, product development and automations. I prefer working with React and Typescript, but also like to learn about new languages and frameworks.

I work as a Senior Frontend Engineer at [Lemonade](https://makers.lemonade.com/), an american insurance company. I focus on perfomance and user experience. Before that I was working at [Framer](https://www.framer.com/) prototyping tool for designers

For the past 7 years I live in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, but originally from Ukraine.

You can contact me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/asci_en) or on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/artem-riasnianskyi-90b99830/)
