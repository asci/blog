# Intro

Hi, I am Artem, a UI developer interested in design systems, product development and automations. I prefer working with React and Typescript, but also like to learn about new languages and frameworks.

I work in Lemonade Inc, an american insurance company as a Senior Frontend Engineer focusing on perfomance and user experience.

For the past 7 years I live in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, but originally from Ukraine.
