    I work as a Senior Frontend Engineer at <a href="https://makers.lemonade.com/"  target="_blank">Lemonade</a>, an american insurance company. I focus on perfomance and user experience. Before that I was working at <a href="https://www.framer.com/" target="_blank">Framer</a> prototyping tool for designers
