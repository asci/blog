  <h1>Intro</h1>
  <p>
    Hi, I am Artem, a UI developer interested in design systems, products and automations. I prefer to work with React and Typescript.
  </p>

  <p>
    I work as a Senior Frontend Engineer at <a href="https://makers.lemonade.com/"  target="_blank">Lemonade</a>, where I focus on perfomance and user experience. Before that I was working at <a href="https://www.framer.com/" target="_blank">Framer</a> prototyping tool for designers. And in the past I was working at <a href="https://yandex.com/company/" target="_blank">Yandex</a> office in Kyiv.
  </p>

  <p>
    Since 2015 I live in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, but originally from Ukraine.
